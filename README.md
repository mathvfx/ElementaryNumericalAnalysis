# Elementary Numerical Analysis
There already exists many advanced numerical techniques to solve hard mathematical problems, thus the chief purpose of this personal project is four-fold:

1. To practice programming method using Python (for now!)  
2. To review and to solidifies understanding in numerical linear algebra for employment in wide-ranging industry
3. As a programming portfolio for insight into my workflow and my thought-process.
4. As a programming portfolio for employment consideration.

### Project Categories
This project will be further categorized into Root Finder, Matrix Algebra, Interpolation, Differentiation and Integration, and Approximation.

#### 1. Root Finder
* Elementary algebraic technique of finding solutions to polynomials. This will serves as a warm-up exercises for what follows.

#### 2. Matrix Algebra
* Elementary matrix algebra techniques to solving system of linear equations. This section will make heavy use of Numpy. We will go as far as approximation techniques for solving eigenvalues problems.

#### 3. Interpolation
* Elementary method for interpolating finite data.

#### 4. Single Variate Numerical Calculus
* Traditional pure mathematics techniques tend to be quite difficult to apply directly in computing. Therefore, we will learn various numerical techniques to differentiate and integrate function of single variables.

#### 5. Approximation Theory
* Approximation theory is important when we consider some tools of linear regression methods for data science.

### Future Consideration
Once we have take care of the above categories, we may return to learn numerical techniques for solving Ordinary Differential Equations with Initial-Values. 


#
### Primary Tools
- Python 3
- Python Library: Numpy, Matplotlib, Scipy, Sympy
- Vim, Jupyter

Since this project will utilize `python3`, we will follow Python's standard coding convention as closely as possible.

### Source and Learning Materials
My source/reference materials are:
 * `CALCULUS IN 3D (Nitecki)`
 * `ELEMENTARY ANALYSIS (Ross)`
 * `LINEAR ALGEBRA DONE RIGHT (Axler)`
 * `NUMERICAL ANALYSIS (Burden and Faires)`
 
I am in no way endorsing any of these textbooks, and my opinions are entirely my own.
