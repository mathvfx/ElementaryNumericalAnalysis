# Elementary Numerical Analysis
  There already exists many advanced numerical techniques to solve hard mathematical problems, thus the chief purpose of this personal project is three folds:
    
      1. To practice programming method using Python (for now!)  
      2. To review and solidifies knowledge in numerical linear algebra for employment in wide-ranging industry
      3. As a programming portfolio for potential employer's consideration of employment

### Category of Elementary Numerical Analysis
  This project will be further categorized into Root Finder, Matrix Algebra, Differentiation, and Integration.

#### 1. Root Finder
  Elementary algebraic technique of finding solutions to polynomials. This will serves as a warm-up exercises for what follows.

#### 2. Matrix Algebra
  Elementary matrix algebra techniques to solving system of linear equations. This section will make heavy use of Numpy. We will go as far as approximation techniques for solving eigenvalues problems.

#### 3. Interpolation
  Elementary method for interpolating finite data.

#### 4. Single Variate Numerical Differentiation and Integration
  Traditional, pure mathematics techniques tend to be quite difficult to apply directly in terms of computing. Therefore, we will learn various numerical techniques to differentiate and integrate functions.

#### 5. Approximation Theory
  Approximation theory here is quite important when we consider the tools of linear regression methods in data science.

### Future Consideration
  Once we have take care of the above categories, we may return to learn numerical techniques for solving Ordinary Differential Equations with Initial-Values.
